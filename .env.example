# Copy this file to `.env` and fill in your Azure AD app values and (optionally) PFX password.
# Do NOT commit your real `.env` file to source control.


# Optional: Certificate password if you mount your own PFX file at ./certs/localhost.pfx
# For development you can leave this empty and the container will generate an untrusted
# self-signed certificate at startup. For production, supply a strong password or use
# Docker secrets. Example (generate a secure password):
#   openssl rand -base64 32
# Windows (PowerShell) alternative:
#   [System.Convert]::ToBase64String((1..32 | ForEach-Object { Get-Random -Maximum 256 } ) -as [byte[]])
# Then set the password below (do not check `.env` into git):
ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password=
# IMPORTANT: Leave this empty if you DO NOT mount a PFX file. The container's entrypoint
# will generate an untrusted self-signed certificate at startup when no PFX is provided,
# and no password is required in that case. Only supply a value when you mount a PFX.

# Notes:
# - To run locally (novice): copy this file to `.env`, set Azure values, then run
#     docker compose up -d
#   The container will generate an untrusted cert at runtime if no PFX is mounted.
# - For advanced usage, create a PFX and mount it at `./certs/localhost.pfx` and set
#   `ASPNETCORE_Kestrel__Certificates__Default__Password` or use Docker secrets.
# Azure AD Configuration
# Get these values from your Azure Portal App Registration
# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: You MUST replace all placeholder values before running!

# TenantId: Use "common" for personal Microsoft accounts
AZURE_TENANT_ID=common

# ClientId: Application (client) ID from Azure Portal
# ⚠️ REPLACE THIS with your actual Client ID!
AZURE_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE

# ClientSecret: The secret value you created (not the Secret ID! the secret value itself)
# ⚠️ REPLACE THIS with your actual Client Secret value!
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET_HERE

# ClientSecretExpiration: Expiration date from Azure Portal (MM/DD/YYYY format)
# Update this to match your secret's expiration date
AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET_EXPIRATION=12/31/2000

# IMPORTANT: Update Azure AD Redirect URIs
# Go to Azure Portal → Your App → Authentication
# Add these redirect URIs:
#   - https://localhost:8081/signin-oidc
#   - https://localhost:8081/signout-callback-oidc
# Or use your actual domain if deploying to production
